### Introduction (5 minutes)

**Greeting and Purpose:**
Hello! Thank you for joining today’s session. I’m [Facilitator’s Name], and I’ll be guiding you through this usability test for the Nobletix app. The purpose of this session is to understand your experience using the app and identify any areas where we can improve the design.

**Overview of the Session:**
During this session, I’ll ask you to perform a few tasks using the app’s wireframes. Please keep in mind that these are early-stage designs, and there might be some elements that aren’t fully functional yet.

**Encourage Thinking Aloud:**
As you go through each task, I’d like you to think aloud and share your thoughts. This helps us understand what’s going through your mind as you interact with the app. Don’t worry about doing things ‘correctly’ or ‘incorrectly’—we’re here to learn from your feedback.

**Consent and Recording:**
Do I have your permission to record this session? The recording will only be used for research purposes and won’t be shared outside the research team.

**Warm-up Question:**
Before we begin, could you tell me a bit about your experience attending or volunteering at social impact events? What motivates you to participate in such events?
